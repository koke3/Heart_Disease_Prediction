## Project Description

The **Heart Disease Prediction** application is an AI-based tool designed to analyze patient data and provide predictions regarding the likelihood of heart disease. The application utilizes a pre-trained model created using the **PyCaret** library, making the analysis and prediction process straightforward and efficient.

The app features a user-friendly graphical interface built with **Streamlit**, offering an easy and intuitive experience for users. Patients can input their health data, such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, and the application will provide predictions about their health status based on this data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- PyCaret
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various health attributes of patients, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
